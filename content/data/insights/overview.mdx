## What is Setu Insights?

Setu’s Insight API gives you actionable insights from a customer's bank statement about their income, expenditure and financial history.

The Setu Insights API consumes financial data uploaded via the Account Aggregator flow. The insights generated can be tailor made to fulfill your specific requirements, ranging from underwriting use cases, to personal finance management.


<Callout type="tip">Along with bank statement analysis, Setu Insights will support analysis of various data sources such as GST, ITR, Insurance etc., as and when these data types become available.

### How does it work?

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/strapi-assets/latest/insights-basic-working/insights-basic-working.png"  style={{ width: "85%", margin: "2em auto" }} />


1.   **Feed data** — Once your customer gives consent to access their financial data, the FIP shares the finance data with you (FIU), via the AA gateway. You feed this data into Setu Insights for analysis. Refer <a href="/data/account-aggregator/quickstart#quickstart-guide">AA docs</a> for a quick explanation of FIU, FIP, AA.

2.   **Analyse financial data** — The raw data goes through a categorization model of Setu Insights and gets bucketed into various categories of incomes, expenses etc.

3.   **Get reports** — Post analysis, the insights are provided to you in the format of your choice.
