## Aadhaar eSign

### What is eSign?

Our eSign APIs enable easy collection of Aadhaar based electronic signatures that are legally enforceable. This is built on top of NSDL’s infrastructure and is fully privacy compliant.

We also provide ready-to-use screens built on top of NSDL’s. These can be easily themed as per your brand colours and logo, and can be loaded inside your app as a webview or redirected to via your website.
