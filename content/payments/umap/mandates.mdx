## Mandates

#### What is a Mandate ?

Unified Payments Interface (UPI) mandates represent a transformative feature within India's digital payment ecosystem, enabling a seamless and automated way to facilitate recurring transactions.

As an integral component of the UPI framework, UPI mandates offer businesses and consumers the convenience of setting up pre-authorized one time / recurring debits for various types of payments such as utility bills, subscription fees, EMIs, and more. This feature not only simplifies the payment process but also enhances the reliability and efficiency of managing recurring financial commitments.

Mandate creation / registration is a one time activity and it allows the customer's account to be debited as per the agreed terms and conditions and recurrence schedule.

For developers and product managers integrating UPI mandates into their applications, the API specification document serves as a crucial guide. It provides detailed information on how to implement UPI mandates, ensuring secure and standardized transaction flows that comply with the guidelines set by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). By leveraging UPI mandates, businesses can offer their customers a user-friendly payment experience that minimizes manual intervention and reduces the risk of missed payments.

As we introduce this API specification, we aim to empower our potential customers with the tools and knowledge needed to seamlessly integrate UPI mandates into their financial services. This document outlines the technical requirements, operational workflows, and security protocols essential for harnessing the full potential of UPI mandates, thereby enabling efficient and automated recurring payments that cater to the evolving needs of the digital economy.

#### Key Features

Some key features of our UPI Mandate Solutions are as follows -

-   Single API to create create any type of UPI Mandate whether that is a recurring or one-time mandate setup via intent or collect
-   Reduced setup and execution drop offs with specifying first execution amount
-   Reduced merchant touchpoints with Auto Execute and Auto Pre-notify features
-   Reduced mandate revocability by leveraging customer non revocability flags
-   Enhanced merchant notifications to give the correct status of a mandate for any merchant or end user action on the mandate with accurate NPCI error codes and responses in case of failures
-   Lesser mandate execution failures with automatic retries built in by default

#### What can I do with a Mandate ?

Here is a list of sample use cases for the mandate products offered by UMAP
- **Recurring mandates** can be used to collect recurring payments for use cases like **Subscriptions**, **Loan Repayments**, **Post Paid Bills**, **Mutual Fund SIPs**, **Wallet Recharges** etc.
For example, Stage offers streaming services. They offer a one week free trial for their users after which the user can signup for monthly plans.
Stage doesn't want to be responsible for notifying the user and collecting payment for every subsequent subscription renewal
To support this use case Stage can integrate with UMAP mandates to
offer creation of a monthly UPI mandate on their website/app. 
When a customer signs up for a monthly subscription plan, Stage registers a monthly mandate via UMAP
and UMAP takes care of notifying the customer and executing / debiting the customer on a monthly basis.
- **One time mandates** can be used to support use cases like **IPO Applications**, **Hotel reservations**, etc.
For example, Zerodha wants to enable users to apply for an IPO on their platform. Based on allocation of shares decided by the sponsor bank, debit should/shouldn't happen for a user.
To support this use case Zerodha can integrate with UMAP mandates to
offer creation of a one time UPI mandate on their platform. 
When a customer signs up for a monthly subscription plan, Stage registers a monthly mandate via UMAP
and UMAP takes care of notifying the customer and executing / debiting the customer on a monthly basis.

#### How does a Mandate work ?

The first step to collect a payment via a mandate is for the **Merchant** to create a mandate. There are 2 ways in which a mandate can be created: **Intent based**, **Collect based**

            Intent based mandates are UPI mandates which are powered via the NPCI intent flow for mandate creation. A simple end user journey for this mandate created via in-app intent is depicted below -

            Here is a typical list of steps involved in collecting a payment from a customer via an intent based mandate. Let’s use the example of `TODO: mention mandate use case`. In this scenario, the lender (`TODO: replace 'lender' based on use case mentioned`) is the Merchant partner that has integrated with Setu.
            <ol>
                <li><b>Merchant</b> sends mandate details to <b>UMAP</b> and receives a unique mandate creation intent link / qr to send to their <b>Customer</b>: `TODO: Redirect to intent based mandate creation`</li>
                <li><b>Customer</b> clicks mandate creation intent link, chooses preferred UPI app / scans the qr on preferred UPI app and enters mPIN to initiate mandate creation.</li>
                <li><b>UMAP</b> triggers a webhook notification on mandate creation initiation which the merchant can use to update mandate status at their end.</li>
                <li>Once the mandate is <b>LIVE</b>, <b>UMAP</b> triggers another webhook notification which the merchant can use to mark mandate status as <b>LIVE</b> at their end.</li>
                <li><b>Merchant</b> triggers a pre debit notification via <b>UMAP</b> 48 - 72 Hrs before debit / execution to let the <b>Customer</b> get notified about the upcoming debit.</li>
                <li>48 - 72 Hrs after the pre debit notification is successful, <b>Merchant</b> triggers mandate execution via <b>UMAP</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Customer</b> receives a collect request notification on their UPI app, clicks on the notification and enters mPIN to authorise the payment.</li>
