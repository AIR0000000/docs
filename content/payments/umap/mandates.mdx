#### What is UPI Autopay ?

Unified Payments Interface (UPI) autopay or mandates represent a transformative feature within India's digital payment ecosystem, enabling a seamless and automated way to facilitate recurring transactions.

As an integral component of the UPI framework, UPI autopay offer businesses and consumers the convenience of setting up pre-authorized one time / recurring debits for various types of payments such as utility bills, subscription fees, EMIs, and more. This feature not only simplifies the payment process but also enhances the reliability and efficiency of managing recurring financial commitments.

Mandate creation / registration is a one time activity and it allows the customer's account to be debited as per the agreed terms and conditions and recurrence schedule.

#### What can I do with UPI Autopay ?

Here is a list of sample use cases for the UPI Autopay products offered by UMAP
- **Recurring mandates** can be used to collect recurring payments for use cases like **Subscriptions**, **Loan Repayments**, **Post Paid Bills**, **Mutual Fund SIPs** etc.
For example,
    - Stage offers streaming services. They offer a one week free trial for their users after which the user can signup for monthly plans.
Stage doesn't want to be responsible for notifying the user and collecting payment for every subsequent subscription renewal
To support this use case Stage can integrate with UMAP mandates to
offer creation of a monthly UPI mandate on their website/app. 
When a customer signs up for a monthly subscription plan, Stage registers a monthly mandate via UMAP
and UMAP takes care of notifying the customer and executing / debiting the customer on a monthly basis.
- **One time mandates** can be used to support use cases like **IPO Applications**, **Hotel reservations**, etc.
For example, Zerodha wants to enable users to apply for an IPO on their platform. Based on allocation of shares decided by the sponsor bank, debit should/shouldn't happen for a user.
To support this use case Zerodha can integrate with UMAP mandates to
offer creation of a one time UPI mandate on their platform. 
When a customer signs up for a monthly subscription plan, Stage registers a monthly mandate via UMAP
and UMAP takes care of notifying the customer and executing / debiting the customer on a monthly basis.
- **Single block multi debit mandates** can be used to support use cases for **securities brokers and dealers**
