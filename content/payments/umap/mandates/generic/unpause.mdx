## Unpausing a paused mandate

Only the end customer has the option of unpausing a paused UPI mandate from their UPI app and there is no merchant intervention required.

When a customer initiates mandate unpause from their UPI app, UMAP will send notifications to the merchant for 3 events **<i>unpause operation initiated, unpause operation confirmation</i>** and **<i>mandate status</i>**. This is depicted in the below diagram
