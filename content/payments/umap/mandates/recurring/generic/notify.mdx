## Mandate Pre Debit Notification

A pre-debit notification needs to be sent to the customer mandatorily before initiating a debit for a particular mandate. This needs to be triggered by the merchant 24 hours before mandate execution. A merchant needs to call the **<i>notify mandates API</i>** to successfully send the pre-debit notification. The process is depicted in the below diagram -

UMAP will send notifications to the merchant **<i>the pre-debit notification operation is completed</i>** and **<i>the final status of the mandate.</i>**
