## Mandate Pause

While only the end customer has the option of pausing a UPI mandate and there is no merchant intervention required, UMAP will send notifications to the merchant when the customer has **<i>initiated a pause, when the pause operation is completed</i>** and **<i>the final status of the mandate</i>**. This is depicted in the below diagram

UMAP will send notifications to the merchant **<i>the pre-debit notification operation is completed</i>** and **<i>the final status of the mandate.</i>**
