## Intent Based Mandate Update

There are only two updates possible on a UPI mandate
- Changing the mandate end date
- Changing the mandate amount

The process for updating a mandate is described in the below diagram:

The merchant will have to call the **<i>modify Mandates API</i>** with the correct set of parameters. Post this, they will receive webhooks for three events: **<i>update operation initiated, update operation confirmation and mandate status notification.</i>**
