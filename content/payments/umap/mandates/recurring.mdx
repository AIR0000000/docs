#### How it works

The first step to collect a payment via a recurring mandate is for the **Merchant** to create a recurring mandate. There are 2 ways in which a recurring mandate can be created: **Intent based**, **Collect based**

            Here is a typical list of steps involved in collecting a payment from a customer via an intent based recurring mandate. Let’s use the example of `TODO: mention recurring mandate use case`. In this scenario, the lender (`TODO: replace 'lender' based on use case mentioned`) is the Merchant partner that has integrated with Setu.
            <ol>
                <li><b>Merchant</b> sends recurring mandate details to <b>UMAP</b> and receives a unique recurring mandate creation intent link / qr to send to their <b>Customer</b>: `TODO: Redirect to intent based recurring mandate creation`</li>
                <li><b>Customer</b> clicks recurring mandate creation intent link, chooses preferred UPI app / scans the qr on preferred UPI app and enters mPIN to initiate recurring mandate creation.</li>
                <li><b>UMAP</b> triggers a webhook notification on recurring mandate creation initiation which the merchant can use to update recurring mandate status at their end.</li>
                <li>Once the mandate is <b>LIVE</b>, <b>UMAP</b> triggers another webhook notification which the merchant can use to mark mandate status as <b>LIVE</b> at their end.</li>
                <li>In every recurrence cycle, the <b>Merchant</b> triggers a pre debit notification via <b>UMAP</b> 48 - 72 Hrs before debit / execution to let the <b>Customer</b> get notified about the upcoming debit.</li>
                <li>48 - 72 Hrs after the pre debit notification is successful, <b>Merchant</b> triggers mandate execution via <b>UMAP</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Customer</b> receives a collect request notification on their UPI app, clicks on the notification and enters mPIN to authorise the payment.</li>
            </ol>
            <Callout type="tip">
                No merchant intervention is needed for recurring pre debit notifications and executions if <code>auto pre debit notification</code> and <code>auto execution</code> are configured while creating a recurring mandate.
