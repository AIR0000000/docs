#### How it works

The first step to collect a payment via a one time mandate is for the **Merchant** to create a one time mandate. There are 2 ways in which a one time mandate can be created: **Intent based**, **Collect based**

            Here is a typical list of steps involved in collecting a payment from a customer via an intent based one time mandate. Let’s use the example of `TODO: mention one time mandate use case`. In this scenario, the lender (`TODO: replace 'lender' based on use case mentioned`) is the Merchant partner that has integrated with Setu.<br/>

            <h6>Step 1 - create a one time mandate</h6>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Merchant</b> sends one time mandate details to <b>UMAP</b> and receives a unique one time mandate creation intent link / qr to send to their <b>Customer</b>: `TODO: Redirect to intent based one time mandate creation`</li>
                <li><b>Customer</b> clicks one time mandate creation intent link, chooses preferred UPI app / scans the qr on preferred UPI app and enters mPIN to initiate one time mandate creation.</li>
                <li><b>UMAP</b> triggers a webhook notification on one time mandate creation initiation which the merchant can use to update one time mandate status at their end.</li>
                <li>Once the mandate is <b>LIVE</b>, <b>UMAP</b> triggers another webhook notification which the merchant can use to mark mandate status as <b>LIVE</b> at their end.</li>
            </ol>
            <hr class="tertiary"/>
            <h6>Step 2 - send a pre debit notification</h6>
            <p><b>Merchant</b> triggers a pre debit notification via <b>UMAP</b> 48 - 72 Hrs before debit / execution to let the <b>Customer</b> get notified about the upcoming debit.</p>
            <hr class="tertiary"/>
            <h6>Step 3 - trigger mandate execution</h6>
            <ol>
                <li>48 - 72 Hrs after the pre debit notification is successful, <b>Merchant</b> triggers mandate execution via <b>UMAP</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Customer</b> receives a collect request notification on their UPI app, clicks on the notification and enters mPIN to authorise the payment.</li>
            </ol>
            <hr class="tertiary"/>
            <h6>Step 4 - check payment status</h6>
            <p><b>Merchant</b> can use check payment status API to check payment statuses associated to the mandate</p>

            Other operations that can be performed on a one time mandate once it is <b>LIVE</b>

                <li>Updating a one time mandate</li>
                <li>Revoking a one time mandate</li>
