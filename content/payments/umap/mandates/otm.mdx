#### What is a One Time Mandate ?

A one time mandate a mandate that can be executed only once at a later date after taking user consent. One time mandates are very useful for conditional flows like:  
* IPO mandates that are executed only on allotment of shares
* Transit systems that debit funds only if ticket is confirmed
* Events platforms can use OTMs for RSVP before confirmations

#### How it works

The first step to collect a payment via a one time mandate is for the merchant to create a one time mandate. There are 2 ways in which a one time mandate can be created:  

**Intent based :** Intent based mandates are always initiated by user through merchant app or by scanning a QR code. 

**Collect based** Collect based mandates are initated by merchant by taking user's VPA as an input and creating a request.

            <h6>Step 1 - create a one time mandate</h6>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Merchant</b> sends one time mandate details to <b>UMAP</b> and receives a unique one time mandate creation intent link / qr to send to their <b>Customer</b></li>
                <li><b>Customer</b> clicks one time mandate creation intent link, chooses preferred UPI app / scans the qr on preferred UPI app and enters mPIN to initiate one time mandate creation.</li>
                <li><b>UMAP</b> triggers a webhook notification on one time mandate creation initiation which the merchant can use to update one time mandate status at their end.</li>
                <li>Once the mandate is <b>LIVE</b>, <b>UMAP</b> triggers another webhook notification which the merchant can use to mark mandate status as <b>LIVE</b> at their end.</li>
            </ol>
            <hr class="tertiary"/>
            <h6>Step 2 - send a pre debit notification</h6>
            <p><b>Merchant</b> triggers a pre debit notification via UMAP <b>48 - 72 Hrs before</b> debit / execution to let the <b>Customer</b> get notified about the upcoming debit.</p>
            <hr class="tertiary"/>
            <h6>Step 3 - trigger mandate execution</h6>
            <ol>
                <Callout type='tip'>Customer only has to provide authorization if amount exceeds ₹15,000</Callout>. 
                
                <li>48 - 72 Hrs after the pre debit notification is successful, <b>Merchant</b> triggers mandate execution via <b>UMAP</b>.</li>
                <li><b>Customer</b> receives a collect request notification on their UPI app, clicks on the notification and enters mPIN to authorise the payment.</li>
            </ol>
            <hr class="tertiary"/>
            <h6>Step 4 - check payment status</h6>
            <p><b>Merchant</b> can use check payment status API to check payment statuses associated to the mandate</p>
