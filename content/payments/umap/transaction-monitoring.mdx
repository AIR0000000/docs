## Transaction Monitoring

### Transaction Statuses

The UMAP platform ensures transparency throughout the transaction process by defining clear statuses that a transaction can assume from initiation to completion. These statuses reflect the transaction's current state, based on the responses received from various entities involved. Understanding these statuses will help merchants manage transactions effectively.

`Payment Initiated :` Payment has been attempted by a customer. 

`Payment Pending :` Payment is currently being processed by UMAP. 

`Payment Successful :` Payment has been successful completed. 

`Payment Failed :` Payment could not be processed.
