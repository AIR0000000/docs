## UMAP Overview

Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a real-time payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India that facilitates inter-bank transactions through a mobile platform. It enables the integration of multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application, offering a seamless and secure interface for initiating and managing financial transactions. The API provides a standardized protocol for payment service providers and merchants, allowing for instant money transfers, bill payments, and merchant payments using a unique identifier (UPI ID) or QR code. UPI's API architecture simplifies the transaction process, making it accessible and efficient for users, while ensuring robust security measures are in place to protect sensitive financial information.
