## UMAP Overview

Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a real-time payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India that facilitates inter-bank transactions through a mobile platform. It enables the integration of multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application, offering a seamless and secure interface for initiating and managing financial transactions. The API provides a standardized protocol for payment service providers and merchants, allowing for instant money transfers, bill payments, and merchant payments using a unique identifier (UPI ID) or QR code.
