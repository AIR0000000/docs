## Overview

### What is UPI

Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a real-time payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) that facilitates inter-bank transactions through a mobile platform.

By offering a seamless and secure interface, UPI simplifies financial transactions, including instant money transfers, bill payments, and merchant transactions. Through its standardized protocol, users can utilize unique identifiers (UPI IDs) or QR codes for swift payments.

The API architecture of UPI streamlines transactions, ensuring accessibility and efficiency for users while maintaining stringent security protocols to safeguard financial data.
