UMAP has consistent and transparent payment statuses across all transaction flows.  

`Payment Initiated :` Payment has been attempted by a customer. 

`Payment Pending :` Payment is currently being processed by UMAP. 

`Payment Successful :` Payment has been successful completed. 

`Payment Failed :` Payment could not be processed.

## Conditional Flows

Conditional flows are optional steps that may be executed in response to specific scenarios post-transaction:

#### Dispute Retrieval

If a customer raises a dispute regarding a transaction, this API call allows for the retrieval of dispute details using a unique identifier, facilitating timely resolution.

#### Initiate Refund

In cases where a dispute arises or as a necessary step in the transaction process, a refund can be initiated. This API, typically prompted by the merchant, reverses the transaction amount to the customer.
