### Details for mandate statuses
Below is a list mandate statuses that are uniform across all types of mandates. Notifications corresponding to them are sent after relevant operations are taken on the mandate by either a merchant, or their customer.

<Text>
    <ul>
        
        <li><code>mandate.initiated</code>{" "}A customer or merchant has initiated creation of mandate</li>
        <li><code>mandate.live</code>{" "}Customer has authorised the mandate, and the mandate is active</li>
        <li><code>mandate.rejected</code>{" "}The mandate could not be set up, due to some error or due to the customer not authorising the mandate</li>
        <li><code>mandate.paused</code>{" "}The customer has decided to pause executions for mandate, which can be temporary</li>
        <li><code>mandate.unpaused</code>{" "}The customer has decided to unpause executions for mandate, and mandate is active again</li>
        <li><code>mandate.revoked</code>{" "}The customer has decided to stop executions for mandate before its expiryâ€”this is a permanent action, and payments from this customer would need a new mandate to be set up</li>
        <li><code>mandate.complete</code>{" "}All mandate executions are complete</li>
    </ul>
