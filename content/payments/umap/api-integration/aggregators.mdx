## Aggregator API Integration

This guide will help you get started with UMAP integration as an Aggregator.

#### Step 1 — Configure a merchant

`TODO:`
This is started once Setu’s sales team has interacted with you and confirmed integration. You will need to provide a few KYC details and review some agreements. Please reach out to <a href="">umap@setu.co</a> to get started.

#### Step 2 — Enable UPI products for merchant

`TODO:`
Contact Setu on <a href="">umap@setu.co</a> to get `x-client-id` and `x-client-secret` details. These credentials are required to make API calls on sandbox or production.
