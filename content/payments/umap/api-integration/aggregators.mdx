## Aggregator API Integration

</Card>

Once the aggregator has been onboarded onto bridge and business formalities have been completed, you can now proceed to integrate UMAP with your internal systems. As an aggregator you have to first create a merchant and then create products that are made available to your merchants based on your configuration.

#### Step 1 — Configure a merchant

An aggregator on UMAP has to first create a merchant associated with them by providing merchant's business details and creating a VPA for the merchant which will associate them to the aggregator. The aggregator can now begin configuring UPI products for the merchant.

    <Text weight="400" marginTop="nano" marginBottom="none" size="small">
        Create your first merchant on UMAP.
    </Text>
</Card>

#### Step 2 — Enable UPI products for merchant

Once a merchant has been associated to your aggregator account, you can now enable UPI payments and subscription products for them using our Payments & Mandates APIs.

    </Portion>
    <Portion desktopSpan="half">
        <Card padding="small" shape="rounded">
            <Link href="payments/umap/mandates">Mandates</Link>
            <Text
                weight="400"
                marginTop="nano"
                marginBottom="none"
                size="small"
            >
                Enable recurring payments with UPI Autopay
            </Text>
        </Card>
    </Portion>
</Row>

#### Step 3 — Manage your merchants

After creating products for your merchants on UMAP, you can also easily manage merchant operations like modifying/disabling them directly on bridge or through our merchant operations APIs.
