Once a merchant has onboarded onto UMAP and has their API credentials, the next step is to choose the right product for your usecase.

### What can you do with UMAP?

##### Payments

-   Offer QR code and payment links for customers in-store or via apps and messaging.
-   Enhance guest checkout with direct UPI collect payments on preferred UPI apps.
-   For BFSI merchants, comply with regulations through Third Party Validation(TPV).

##### Autopay

-   Use one-time mandates to clear limited stock exclusively for designated customers.
-   Instantly create service subscriptions with UPI Autopay for recurring payments.
-   Replicate wallet functionality with single block multi-debit mandates from savings accounts.
