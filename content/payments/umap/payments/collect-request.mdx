## Accept UPI payments with Collect Requests

The Collect Request in UPI is a customer-driven payment mode where the merchant initiates a transaction by providing the customer's Virtual Payment Address (VPA). Upon initiation, the customer receives a notification on their UPI app to authorize the transaction, facilitating a seamless payment completion.

### Step 1 - Verify Customer VPA
In collect, a merchant needs to accept customer vpa as input to create a collect request at customer’s UPI app. The merchant can verify the validity of the vpa input my the customer using this API.

</a>

### Step 2 - Create Collect Request
A collect product instance is created by the merchant inputting the customer's VPA. This action triggers a collect request, notifying the customer through their UPI app to proceed with the transaction.

### Step 3 - Retrieve Collect Request
After the customer responds to the collect request, transaction details can be fetched using a unique identifier or retrieval reference number, enabling merchants to access specific collect request.
