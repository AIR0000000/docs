## Collect Request

The Collect Request in UPI is a customer-driven payment mode where the merchant initiates a transaction by providing the customer's Virtual Payment Address (VPA). Upon initiation, the customer receives a notification on their UPI app to authorize the transaction, facilitating a seamless payment completion.

### Collect Request Creation(create Collect API)
A collect product instance is created by the merchant inputting the customer's VPA. This action triggers a collect request, notifying the customer through their UPI app to proceed with the transaction.
