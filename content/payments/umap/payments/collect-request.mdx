## Collect Request

The Collect Request in UPI is a customer-driven payment mode where the merchant initiates a transaction by providing the customer's Virtual Payment Address (VPA). Upon initiation, the customer receives a notification on their UPI app to authorize the transaction, facilitating a seamless payment completion.

### Verify Customer VPA(verify customer-vpa API): 
In collect, a merchant needs to accept customer vpa as input to create a collect request at customer’s UPI app. The merchant can verify the validity of the vpa input my the customer using this API.
