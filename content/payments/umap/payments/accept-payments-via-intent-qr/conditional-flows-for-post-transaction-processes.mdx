Conditional flows are optional steps that may be executed in response to specific scenarios post-transaction:

**Dispute Retrieval (fetchById disputes API):** If a customer raises a dispute regarding a transaction, this API call allows for the retrieval of dispute details using a unique identifier, facilitating timely resolution.

**Initiate Refund (create Refund API):** In cases where a dispute arises or as a necessary step in the transaction process, a refund can be initiated. This API, typically prompted by the merchant, reverses the transaction amount to the customer.

These steps and conditional flows ensure merchants can efficiently manage transactions, from initiation to resolution, providing a streamlined payment experience for customers through the UMAP platform.
