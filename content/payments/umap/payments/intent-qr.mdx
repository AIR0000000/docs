## Accept UPI payments with Intent / QR

Merchants can offer their customers a seamless payment experience by utilizing UMAP APIs to create payment links. These links can either be directly integrated into their applications or converted into QR codes for easy scanning. Below is a detailed guide on how to implement this process:

### Step 1 - Create Payment Link
The merchant generates a payment link. This unique link serves as the gateway for customers to initiate intent transactions via their Third-Party Application Provider (TPAP).

<Tabs

    {
      key: "1",
      label: "Pay Single",
      content: (
        <>
          <CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">

          </CodeBlockWithCopy>
          <Callout type="note">
            <strong>amount</strong> is a mandatory field
          </Callout>
          <br/>
          <p>By creating a payment link with paymentType as <code>pay_single</code>
            you can accept the payment only once.
          </p>
        </>
      ),
    },
     {
      key: "2",
      label: "Pay Multi",
      content: (
        <>
          <CodeBlockWithCopy language="json">
            {`{

  "transactionNote": "testpay"
}}`}
          </CodeBlockWithCopy>
         <Callout type="note">
            <strong>amount</strong> is not required when creating multi use payment link
          </Callout>
          <br/>
          <p>By creating a payment link with paymentType as <code>pay_multi</code>
            you can accept the payment more than once.
          </p>
        </>
      ),
    }
  ]}

### Step 2 - Customer Initiates Transaction
Customers use the generated payment link to commence the payment process through their UPI app. This action triggers the transaction flow, engaging the UMAP system to process the payment.

### Step 3 - Retrieve Payment Details
Following the initiation of the transaction, the system retrieves the payment details. This retrieval is based on the payment link ID or a reference number, ensuring you have access to transaction information for confirmation and record-keeping.
