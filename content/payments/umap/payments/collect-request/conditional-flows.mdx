**Dispute Retrieval (fetchById disputes API):**  If a dispute arises, merchants can retrieve detailed dispute information through the fetchById disputes function, using a specific identifier related to the transaction in question.

**Initiate Refund (create Refund API):** Should a refund be necessary, either as a resolution to a dispute or as a part of the collection process, the create Refund function allows merchants to initiate a refund transaction directly.

This process ensures that merchants have the flexibility to manage payments effectively, offering a pathway to resolve disputes and process refunds, thereby enhancing the customer experience.
