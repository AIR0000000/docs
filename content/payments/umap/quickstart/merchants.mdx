### What is an Merchant

A merchant on UMAP is any business that wants to collect UPI payments from their customers to provide goods & services or use UPI autopay for setting up recurring payments like subscriptions with their customers.

### Get started

##### Step 1 - Register on Bridge

Merchants can integrate with UMAP by directly registering themselves on Setu's bridge which will serve as the command center for all UPI products used by them. Merchants can configure payment methods,vpas, settlements, notifications & more directly from bridge.

##### Step 3. Authorization and access

`TODO: You can use the API credentials from Bridge to test UMAP on sandbox`
