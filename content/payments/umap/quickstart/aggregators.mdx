## UMAP Quickstart for Aggregators

This guide will help you get started with UMAP integration as an Aggregator.

### What is an Aggregator

`TODO : Write about what an Aggregator user is`

You're not an Aggregator? Please refer to the [Quickstart](/payments/umap/quickstart) for other types of integration possible

#### Step 1 — Start KYC and business documentation

This is started once Setu’s sales team has interacted with you and confirmed integration. You will need to provide a few KYC details and review some agreements. Please reach out to <a href="">umap@setu.co</a> to get started.

#### Step 2 — Get API credentials

Contact Setu on <a href="">umap@setu.co</a> to get `x-client-id` and `x-client-secret` details. These credentials are required to make API calls on sandbox or production.

#### Step 3 — Test on sandbox

You can use the API credentials provided by Setu to test UMAP on sandbox
