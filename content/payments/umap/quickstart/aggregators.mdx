#### Who is an aggregator?

An aggregator on UMAP is a large merchant platform that on-boards multiple merchants under them. It can be an online platform or large businesses that operate franchisees. An aggregator on UMAP has the ability to configure and control how their merchants process payments, like by enabling different payment methods, settlement accounts and notifications.

Are you not an Aggregator? Please refer to the [Merchant quickstart](/payments/umap/quickstart) instead.

#### Get started

###### Step 1 — Start KYC and business documentation

As an aggregator, the first step for you is to interact with Setu’s sales team to determine the solution that will best meet your needs. Right after that, we will start collecting business KYC details and finalise commerical agreements. After business formalities are over, Setu will create an aggregator account and you can start creating merchants to offer UPI products to them.
