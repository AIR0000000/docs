## UMAP Quickstart for Aggregators

This guide will help you get started with UMAP integration as an Aggregator.

### What is an Aggregator
An aggregator on UMAP is a large merchant platform that onboards multiple merchants under them. It can be an online platform or large businesses that operate franchisees. An aggregator on UMAP has the ability to configure and control the payments processes for their merchants like enabling different payment methods, settlement accounts and notifications.  

You're not an Aggregator? Please refer to the [Quickstart](/payments/umap/quickstart) for other types of integration possible

### Get started

#### Step 1 — Start KYC and business documentation

This is started once Setu’s sales team has interacted with you and finalized the solution that will best meet your needs. After that, we will need business KYC details and finalize commerical agreements. After business formalities are over, an aggregator account is created for you in the system based on the documents submitted and you can begin creating merchants!

#### Step 2 — Get API credentials

Contact Setu on <a href="">umap@setu.co</a> to get `x-client-id` and `x-client-secret` details. These credentials are required to make API calls on sandbox or production.
