## Introduction to types of integrations available

Merchant can integrate in the following two modes.

1. Seamless
2. iFrame

## Seamless

If a merchant is [PCI DSS compliant](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/maintaining_payment_security) then they can integrate in the seamless mode. In this mode a merchant can accept card instrument details on their own website and call Plural's APIs in S2S mode.

## iFrame

For merchants who are not [PCI DSS compliant,](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/maintaining_payment_security) iFrame mode is the right choice. The iFrame checkout screen comes up as a seamless pop-up on the merchant website (as shown below) giving the user a good payment experience.
